# 100K Step Club — Project Instructions

## What This Is
The landing page for 100K Step Club — a global community around walking
100,000 steps in a single day. First global event: May 2, 2026.

## Context Files
Read these before doing anything:
- `.claude/context/2026-02-05_context.md` — Full project context
- `.claude/context/2026-02-06_100K_Step_Club_Mission_Brief.md` — Mission brief

## Skills
- `.claude/skills/100k-brand-voice/SKILL.md` — Brand voice and anti-AI writing patterns. Follow this for ALL copy.

## Tech Stack
- Plain HTML / CSS / JavaScript (no frameworks, no build tools)
- Supabase for database (signup form storage)
- Hosted on Vercel via GitHub
- Mobile-first design

## Rules
1. Every piece of copy must follow the brand voice skill. No AI slop.
2. The landing page must work perfectly on mobile.
3. No unnecessary dependencies. Keep it simple.
4. Supabase config lives in js/config.js (credentials already set up).
