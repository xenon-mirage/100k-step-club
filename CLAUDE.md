# 100K Step Club — Project Instructions

## What This Is
The landing page for 100K Step Club — a global community around walking
100,000 steps in a single day. First global event: May 2, 2026.

## Reference
The following reference files are in `ReferenceFiles/` and must be consulted:

- **Brand Voice** (`march-1_graeme-voice-file.md`) — The canonical voice guide. Use for ALL content: website copy, social media, email, and any other communications. No exceptions.
- **Design System** (`100K-Design-System-v1.html`) — Fonts, colours, hex codes, and visual direction. Reference for all digital asset creation: website, email, social assets, and future mobile app.
- **Asset Specifications** (`100K-Asset-Specifications.html`) — Reference file for required assets and their specifications.

## Tech Stack
- Plain HTML / CSS / JavaScript (no frameworks, no build tools)
- Supabase for database (signup form storage)
- Hosted on Vercel via GitHub
- Mobile-first design

## Rules
1. Every piece of copy must follow the brand voice in ReferenceFiles. No AI slop.
2. The landing page must work perfectly on mobile.
3. No unnecessary dependencies. Keep it simple.
4. Supabase config lives in js/config.js (credentials already set up).
