---

## The Project

### Core Concept
100K Step Club is a branded community around an extreme walking challenge: completing 100,000 steps before midnight in a single day. The model combines:
- **Progression system**: Tiered badges from 10K â†’ 25K â†’ 50K â†’ 75K â†’ 100K
- **Monthly synchronized events**: Global participation days
- **Verification standards**: Strava/Garmin proof required
- **Content flywheel**: Every attempt becomes a story
- **Physical merch**: Custom socks via DeFeet partnership

### Brand Identity

**Taglines:**
- Primary: "Life at walking pace. One day. 100K steps."
- Challenge: "Beat Midnight"
- Invitation: "Start at 10K. Earn your way up."

**Tier Names & Themes:**
| Tier | Name | Theme |
|------|------|-------|
| 10K | First Light | Entry point, most people have done this |
| 25K | In The Flow | Half-marathon territory, rhythm established |
| 50K | Heating Up | Decision point - commit or quit |
| 75K | Enter Night | Pain cave, sun down, elite territory |
| 100K | Beat Midnight | Must finish before midnight - hard rule |

**Tone:** "Leopard seal" - warm and inclusive, but with an edge. Acknowledges difficulty without gatekeeping.

## Key Dates

- **Current date in conversation:** February 4-5, 2026
- **Solo proof attempt:** April 4, 2026
- **Global event (first official 100K Day):** May 2, 2026

---

## Competitive Landscape

**Key finding:** No branded 100K step community exists.

**What's out there:**
- YouTubers do one-off attempts for content (Markiplier, Will Tennyson, JackSucksAtLife)
- TikTok viral videos (Paula Rodrigues 2.7M views)
- American Bionics Project: Nonprofit fundraiser, allows team splitting
- Corporate wellness: Focus on daily 10K, not extreme challenges
- Strava: Group challenges limited to 199 participants, no native step challenges

**Whitespace claimed:** Branded community with progression, monthly events, verification standards, physical merch, content flywheel.

## Vision Statement (For Sharing)

> "I'm building a global community around walking 100,000 steps in a single dayâ€”a challenge so hard that finishing before midnight puts you in an elite club most people will never join. The model is simple: a progression system from 10K to 100K, monthly synchronized events, branded socks, and content that turns every attempt into a story."

## Immediate Next Actions (As of Feb 5)

1. Reply to badge post comments on Instagram
2. Set up Discord server
3. Set up Substack
4. Create landing page (Carrd.co)
5. Post Discord/newsletter links
6. Send 10 personal DMs

---

## Technical Notes

The Sun Tracker visualization needs for production:
- Database (Firebase/Supabase) for persistence
- Proper authentication for admin
- Image upload for proof screenshots
- Email notifications for submissions

Current version uses React state only (resets on refresh).

## Validation Thesis

If 50 people attempt a tier on May 2 and 25 post debriefs, the flywheel exists. If not, Graeme will know within 3 months before over-investing.
