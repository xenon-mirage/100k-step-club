# Walk to the Sun — Community Milestone Tracker
### 100K Step Club | Foundational Reference Document (v3)

---

## The Mission

Walk to the sun. Together. Every verified step day — from a 10K First Light to a full 100K Beat Midnight — adds to the collective counter. The destination is the sun: **93 million miles away, or approximately 187 billion steps.**

This document defines every milestone along the way. Each one is a moment to celebrate, a reason to post, a marker of what this community has done together.

---

## Conversion Basis

All calculations use an average step length of **0.8 metres (2.625 feet)**. Distances are approximate and rounded for readability. The point is the story, not the decimal.

- 10,000 steps ≈ 8 km / 5 mi
- 100,000 steps ≈ 80 km / 50 mi
- 1,000,000 steps ≈ 800 km / 500 mi

## Phase 1: The Neighbourhood (0 — 1 Million Steps)

*The first steps feel small. They aren't.*

| # | Milestone Name | Cumulative Steps | Distance | Real-World Equivalent |
|---|---------------|-----------------|----------|----------------------|
| 1 | First Steps | 10,000 | 8 km / 5 mi | A Parkrun and back. The very first mark on the counter |
| 2 | The Half Marathon | 25,000 | 20 km / 12.4 mi | 13.1 miles — the first real endurance distance |
| 3 | The Marathon | 50,000 | 40 km / 25 mi | 26.2 miles. The community just ran one together |
| 4 | The Channel | 75,000 | 60 km / 37 mi | Dover to Calais and back. Across the English Channel without getting wet |
| 5 | The Ultra | 100,000 | 80 km / 50 mi | 50 miles — official ultramarathon distance |
| 6 | Hadrian's Wall | 150,000 | 120 km / 75 mi | Coast to coast across Northern England, the old Roman frontier |
| 7 | The Suez Canal | 250,000 | 200 km / 124 mi | Through the canal that connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea |
| 8 | The Camino | 500,000 | 400 km / 249 mi | The Camino de Santiago pilgrim trail across Spain |
| 9 | London to Edinburgh | 650,000 | 520 km / 325 mi | Capital to capital, the full length of Great Britain's spine |
| 10 | The Great Walk | 1,000,000 | 800 km / 497 mi | Sydney to Melbourne, coast to coast through the Australian bush |

**Context:** These fall fast. A single event with 20 mixed-tier participants could blow through multiple milestones in one day. Each one is an Instagram post, a Discord celebration, a newsletter mention. Stack the early wins.

## Phase 2: Crossing Borders (1 Million — 10 Million Steps)

*We've left home. Now we're covering real ground.*

| # | Milestone Name | Cumulative Steps | Distance | Real-World Equivalent |
|---|---------------|-----------------|----------|----------------------|
| 11 | The Rhine | 1,250,000 | 1,000 km / 621 mi | Source to sea — the great river of Western Europe, Alps to North Sea |
| 12 | The Boot | 1,500,000 | 1,200 km / 746 mi | The full length of Italy, from the Alps to Sicily |
| 13 | The Iditarod | 2,000,000 | 1,600 km / 994 mi | Anchorage to Nome — the legendary dogsled route across Alaska |
| 14 | The Appalachian | 2,750,000 | 2,200 km / 1,367 mi | End to end of the Appalachian Trail — Georgia to Maine |
| 15 | Coast to Coast | 3,000,000 | 2,400 km / 1,491 mi | Across Australia at its narrowest — Adelaide to Darwin |
| 16 | The Mississippi | 3,750,000 | 3,000 km / 1,864 mi | Source to sea — Lake Itasca, Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico |
| 17 | The Tour de France | 4,375,000 | 3,500 km / 2,175 mi | The full route of cycling's greatest race. On foot |
| 18 | Route 66 | 5,000,000 | 4,000 km / 2,485 mi | Chicago to Los Angeles. The mother road |
| 19 | The Amazon | 6,250,000 | 5,000 km / 3,107 mi | Source to mouth of the world's mightiest river |
| 20 | The Nile | 8,375,000 | 6,700 km / 4,163 mi | The full length of the world's longest river |
| 21 | The Trans-Siberian | 9,375,000 | 7,500 km / 4,660 mi | Moscow to Vladivostok — the longest railway on Earth |
| 22 | The Silk Road | 10,000,000 | 8,000 km / 4,971 mi | Constantinople to Beijing. The ancient route that connected civilisations |

**Context:** This phase likely spans the first 6-12 months. Every milestone here has a rich story behind it. Use them — the Camino is about pilgrimage, the Iditarod is about survival, Route 66 is about the open road. Match the milestone to the community's mood.

## Phase 3: Going Global (10 Million — 100 Million Steps)

*We've walked a country. Now we walk the world.*

| # | Milestone Name | Cumulative Steps | Distance | Real-World Equivalent |
|---|---------------|-----------------|----------|----------------------|
| 23 | Pole to Pole | 12,500,000 | 10,000 km / 6,214 mi | North Pole to South Pole through the heart of the Earth |
| 24 | The Pacific Crossing | 17,500,000 | 14,000 km / 8,699 mi | Tokyo to San Francisco — across the world's largest ocean |
| 25 | The Dakar Rally | 18,750,000 | 15,000 km / 9,321 mi | The most gruelling motorsport route on Earth. We did it on foot |
| 26 | The Great Wall | 25,000,000 | 20,000 km / 12,427 mi | The full length of the Great Wall of China, every branch, every ruin |
| 27 | The Pan-American | 37,500,000 | 30,000 km / 18,641 mi | Alaska to Argentina — the longest road in the world |
| 28 | 🌍 Around the World | 50,000,000 | 40,075 km / 24,901 mi | The circumference of the Earth. We walked around the planet |
| 29 | Magellan's Voyage | 62,500,000 | 50,000 km / 31,069 mi | The full distance of the first circumnavigation of the globe. It took Magellan's crew 3 years. It took his life |
| 30 | Twice Around | 100,000,000 | 80,000 km / 49,710 mi | Two full laps of Earth. 100 million steps |

**Context:** "Around the World" is the first truly iconic milestone. Massive celebration. The Pan-American is an underrated banger — the longest road humans have ever built, and we walked the whole thing.

---

## Phase 4: Leaving Earth (100 Million — 1 Billion Steps)

*The planet is behind us. We're looking up now.*

| # | Milestone Name | Cumulative Steps | Distance | Real-World Equivalent |
|---|---------------|-----------------|----------|----------------------|
| 31 | The Diameter of Earth | 112,500,000 | 90,000 km / 55,923 mi | If we'd walked straight down and out the other side, this is how far |
| 32 | Five Times Around | 125,000,000 | 100,000 km / 62,137 mi | Five complete trips around the planet |
| 33 | Satellite Belt | 225,000,000 | 180,000 km / 111,847 mi | Past the altitude of geostationary satellites — we've left human infrastructure behind |
| 34 | Halfway to the Moon | 240,000,000 | 192,000 km / 119,303 mi | Equidistant between Earth and Moon. The point of no return |
| 35 | One Light-Second | 375,000,000 | 300,000 km / 186,411 mi | The distance light travels in one heartbeat. We walked it step by step |
| 36 | 🌙 THE MOON | 480,000,000 | 384,400 km / 238,855 mi | We reached the Moon. One giant leap for step-kind |
| 37 | The Dark Side | 500,000,000 | 400,000 km / 248,548 mi | Half a billion steps. Past the Moon and into the unknown |
| 38 | Two Light-Seconds | 750,000,000 | 600,000 km / 372,823 mi | Two heartbeats of light. Three-quarters of a billion steps |
| 39 | Deep Space | 1,000,000,000 | 800,000 km / 497,097 mi | One billion steps. We are officially in deep space |

**Context:** Reaching the Moon probably takes 2-4 years. It should be the biggest event in the community's history to that point. The light-second milestones add poetry — connecting human walking pace to the speed of light is the kind of contrast that gives people chills.

---

## Phase 5: The Inner Void (1 Billion — 10 Billion Steps)

*The Moon is a memory. The void between worlds is vast. These markers keep us company.*

| # | Milestone Name | Cumulative Steps | Distance | Real-World Equivalent |
|---|---------------|-----------------|----------|----------------------|
| 40 | 3x the Moon | 1,440,000,000 | 1,150,000 km / 714,000 mi | Three return trips to the Moon |
| 41 | The James Webb | 1,875,000,000 | 1,500,000 km / 932,000 mi | The L2 Lagrange point — where the James Webb Telescope orbits, staring into the beginning of time |
| 42 | The Diameter of the Sun | 2,500,000,000 | 2,000,000 km / 1,243,000 mi | If the Sun were sitting in front of us, we'd have walked across it |
| 43 | 10x the Moon | 4,800,000,000 | 3,840,000 km / 2,386,000 mi | Ten trips to the Moon and back. We could run a shuttle service |
| 44 | Five Light-Seconds | 5,625,000,000 | 4,500,000 km / 2,796,000 mi | Five seconds of light. Billions of seconds of walking |
| 45 | 10 Light-Seconds | 7,500,000,000 | 6,000,000 km / 3,728,000 mi | A beam of light is ten seconds old. We're still going |

**Context:** The psychological challenge here is the growing silence between milestones. "The Diameter of the Sun" is a great one to celebrate because it makes the abstract tangible — we walked across a star.

---

## Phase 6: Approaching Venus (10 Billion — 50 Billion Steps)

*Something bright is getting closer. The morning star.*

| # | Milestone Name | Cumulative Steps | Distance | Real-World Equivalent |
|---|---------------|-----------------|----------|----------------------|
| 46 | 30 Light-Seconds | 11,250,000,000 | 9,000,000 km / 5,592,000 mi | Half a minute of light. An age of footsteps |
| 47 | 50x the Moon | 12,000,000,000 | 9,600,000 km / 5,965,000 mi | Fifty Moon trips. What once seemed impossible is now just a waypoint |
| 48 | One Light-Minute | 22,500,000,000 | 18,000,000 km / 11,185,000 mi | The distance light covers in 60 seconds. It took us... longer |
| 49 | Halfway to Venus | 24,375,000,000 | 19,500,000 km / 12,117,000 mi | We can see Venus from here. The morning star is calling |
| 50 | 100x the Moon | 24,000,000,000 | 19,200,000 km / 11,932,000 mi | One hundred trips to the Moon. The counter has twelve digits now |
| 51 | Two Light-Minutes | 45,000,000,000 | 36,000,000 km / 22,370,000 mi | Two minutes of light. Years of walking |
| 52 | 🪐 VENUS | 48,750,000,000 | 39,000,000 km / 24,233,000 mi | Venus at closest approach. The hottest planet in the solar system. We walked there |

**Context:** Venus is planet number two. By this point, 100K Step Club isn't a community — it's a legacy. The light-minute and Moon-multiple milestones maintain rhythm through the void.

---

## Phase 7: The Crossing to Mars (50 Billion — 70 Billion Steps)

*Two planets down. The red one is next.*

| # | Milestone Name | Cumulative Steps | Distance | Real-World Equivalent |
|---|---------------|-----------------|----------|----------------------|
| 53 | 150x the Moon | 50,000,000,000 | 40,000,000 km / 24,855,000 mi | 150 trips to the Moon. Fifty billion steps. Let that sink in |
| 54 | Three Light-Minutes | 56,250,000,000 | 45,000,000 km / 27,962,000 mi | Three minutes at light speed. A generation at walking pace |
| 55 | Halfway to Mars | 58,375,000,000 | 46,700,000 km / 29,018,000 mi | Mars is now closer than Venus. We can see the red dust from here |
| 56 | 🪐 MARS | 68,750,000,000 | 55,000,000 km / 34,175,000 mi | Mars at closest approach. Humanity wants to send rockets. We sent footsteps |

**Context:** The Venus-to-Mars crossing is "only" 20 billion steps. Having the 150x Moon marker, the halfway point, and the three light-minute post keeps the drumbeat alive.

---

## Phase 8: Into the Fire (70 Billion — 100 Billion Steps)

*Mars is behind us. We've turned toward the Sun. It's getting warm.*

| # | Milestone Name | Cumulative Steps | Distance | Real-World Equivalent |
|---|---------------|-----------------|----------|----------------------|
| 57 | Four Light-Minutes | 75,000,000,000 | 60,000,000 km / 37,282,000 mi | Four minutes of light. 75 billion steps of walking. Both are real |
| 58 | 200x the Moon | 76,800,000,000 | 61,440,000 km / 38,177,000 mi | Two hundred lunar voyages |
| 59 | Mercury's Orbit | 82,500,000,000 | 66,000,000 km / 41,010,000 mi | We've crossed the orbit of Mercury — no planets left between us and the Sun |
| 60 | Halfway to the Sun | 93,500,000,000 | 74,800,000 km / 46,488,000 mi | The halfway point. We can feel the heat. There is no turning back |
| 61 | Five Light-Minutes | 93,750,000,000 | 75,000,000 km / 46,603,000 mi | A beam of light left the Sun five minutes ago. It just reached us |
| 62 | 250x the Moon | 96,000,000,000 | 76,800,000 km / 47,722,000 mi | A quarter-thousand Moon trips. The numbers have become absurd. So has the achievement |

**Context:** "No planets left between us and the Sun" is a powerful moment. From here forward, every step is into uncharted territory. The halfway point and five light-minutes hit almost simultaneously — use both.

---

## Phase 9: The Final Approach (100 Billion — 150 Billion Steps)

*The Sun fills the sky. It's all we can see.*

| # | Milestone Name | Cumulative Steps | Distance | Real-World Equivalent |
|---|---------------|-----------------|----------|----------------------|
| 63 | 100 Billion | 100,000,000,000 | 80,000,000 km / 49,710,000 mi | Twelve digits on the counter. One hundred billion verified steps |
| 64 | Six Light-Minutes | 112,500,000,000 | 90,000,000 km / 55,923,000 mi | Six minutes at the speed of light. Decades at the speed of walking |
| 65 | 300x the Moon | 115,200,000,000 | 92,160,000 km / 57,266,000 mi | Three hundred lunar voyages |
| 66 | Seven Light-Minutes | 131,250,000,000 | 105,000,000 km / 65,243,000 mi | Seven minutes of light |
| 67 | 500x the Moon | 144,000,000,000 | 115,200,000 km / 71,581,000 mi | Five hundred trips to the Moon. Half a thousand |
| 68 | The Sunlight Mark | 150,000,000,000 | 120,000,000 km / 74,565,000 mi | 8 minutes and 20 seconds — this is how long sunlight takes to reach Earth. We're walking into the source |

**Context:** The light-minute markers serve as a countdown. Seven... six... five... Each one is another minute closer to the Sun. The community knows what's coming.

---

## Phase 10: Arrival (150 Billion — 187 Billion Steps)

*We can see the surface. Every step is a gift. Every step is earned.*

| # | Milestone Name | Cumulative Steps | Distance | Real-World Equivalent |
|---|---------------|-----------------|----------|----------------------|
| 69 | 1,000x the Moon | 168,000,000,000 | 134,400,000 km / 83,505,000 mi | One thousand trips to the Moon. From "one small step" to one thousand giant leaps |
| 70 | 90% There | 168,300,000,000 | 134,640,000 km / 83,654,000 mi | Nine-tenths of the way. We can count what's left |
| 71 | Nine Light-Minutes | 168,750,000,000 | 135,000,000 km / 83,885,000 mi | Nine minutes of light. The countdown is almost over |
| 72 | The Final Billion | 186,000,000,000 | 148,800,000 km / 92,444,000 mi | One billion steps to go. The last stretch |
| 73 | The Final Mile | 186,875,000,000 | 149,500,000 km / 92,900,000 mi | 100,000 km to go. One hundred million steps. One last push |
| 74 | ☀️ THE SUN | 187,000,000,000 | 149,600,000 km / 93,000,000 mi | **We walked to the sun.** 93 million miles. Every step verified. Every step earned. Together |

**Context:** If we ever reach this milestone, it will be one of the most extraordinary collective achievements in the history of endurance community. Thousands — maybe tens of thousands — of people, across years, maybe decades, each contributing their verified steps to something bigger than themselves. That is the entire point.

| Phase | Name | Step Range | # of Milestones | Avg Gap |
|-------|------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | The Neighbourhood | 0 — 1M | 10 | 100K |
| 2 | Crossing Borders | 1M — 10M | 12 | 750K |
| 3 | Going Global | 10M — 100M | 8 | 11.25M |
| 4 | Leaving Earth | 100M — 1B | 9 | 100M |
| 5 | The Inner Void | 1B — 10B | 6 | 1.5B |
| 6 | Approaching Venus | 10B — 50B | 7 | 5.7B |
| 7 | Crossing to Mars | 50B — 70B | 4 | 5B |
| 8 | Into the Fire | 70B — 100B | 6 | 5B |
| 9 | Final Approach | 100B — 150B | 6 | 8.3B |
| 10 | Arrival | 150B — 187B | 6 | 6.2B |

The early phases are deliberately dense — when the community is small and young, frequent wins keep energy high. As the community grows and the step counter accelerates, larger gaps between milestones feel appropriate because the velocity of steps is higher.

## Verification Rules

1. **Only verified steps count.** Strava, Garmin, Apple Health, or equivalent proof required. Screenshots must show date, step count, and duration.

2. **Every tier counts.** A 10K First Light adds 10,000 steps. A 100K Beat Midnight adds 100,000. The counter doesn't discriminate — it just grows.

3. **One entry per person per day.** You can't log a 50K day as five separate 10K entries. Your highest verified tier for that day is what counts.

4. **No retroactive logging.** Steps count from the day you join the community forward. We're walking to the sun together, starting now.

5. **Step length is standardised.** 0.8m per step across the board. Individual stride length varies, but consistency matters more than precision for a collective tracker.

6. **Planetary distances use closest approach.** Venus at ~39M km, Mars at ~55M km. Orbital positions vary, but we use the most optimistic number — because optimism is on brand.

## How This Gets Used

**Now (manual tracking):** Verified step days posted in Discord with proof. Running total maintained and announced weekly in the newsletter. Next milestone pinned in Discord.

**Next (web dashboard):** Live counter, next milestone with progress bar, individual contribution stats, community leaderboard. Centrepiece of the landing page.

**Later (automated):** API integration with Strava/Garmin. Auto-verified submissions. Individual profiles. Milestone celebrations trigger events and merch drops.

**Content at every milestone:**
- Social post with custom graphic
- Newsletter spotlight on the members who pushed us past the line
- Discord celebration thread
- Milestone-specific merch for the major ones (planets, Around the World, etc.)
- Retrospective: "It took us X days and Y members to walk from [last milestone] to [this one]"
